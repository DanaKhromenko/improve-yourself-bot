Gamified Telegram Bot for Personal Growth in Golang

A personal GitHub project featuring a Telegram bot developed in Go, utilizing the `telegram-bot-api` library. The bot, designed for an educational video shared on YouTube, enables users, either individually or within Telegram groups, to gamify their lives.

The concept revolves around incentivizing users to complete beneficial actions that enhance their well-being, such as learning new skills or staying active. The challenge lies in sustaining motivation and willpower for such actions. Conversely, the bot acknowledges the allure of enjoyable yet potentially unproductive activities like indulging in treats or watching videos.

Users earn virtual coins by completing positive tasks, which can later be traded for the privilege to perform occasional "indulgent" actions. This creative approach merges gamification with personal development, promoting a balanced lifestyle.

Through this Telegram bot, users embark on an engaging journey of self-improvement, leveraging rewards and community support. For insights into the project's implementation and features, check the linked YouTube video. Contributions and feedback are welcomed as we refine this innovative approach to motivation and growth.
